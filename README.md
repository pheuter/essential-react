## Design Goals

- Use fewer tools (no yeoman, gulp, bower, etc...)
- Babel 6 with Webpack and Hot Loader
- Fast testing with mocked-out DOM
- Import css files as class names
- Separate [Smart and Dumb](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) components
- No specific implementation of Flux or data fetching patterns


## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
$ npm run server
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080/** to view the app.

## Commands

A core philosophy of this skeleton app is to keep the tooling to a minimum. For this reason, you can find all the commands in the `scripts` section of [package.json](package.json).

### server

```sh
$ npm run server
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

This leverages [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) to automatically start a local dev server and refresh file changes on the fly without reloading the page.

It also automatically includes source maps, allowing you to browse code and set breakpoints on the original ES6 code:

### build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

**Output:** `build/app.js`

Build minified app for production using the [production](http://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html#production-shortcut-p) shortcut.

### test

```sh
$ npm test
```

**Input:** `test/main.js`

**Output:** `coverage/`

Leverages [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) to execute the test suite and generate code coverage reports using [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)

### coveralls

```sh
$ npm run coveralls
```

**Input:** `coverage/lcov.info`

Sends the code coverage report generated by [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io/).

### clean

```sh
$ npm run clean
```

**Input:** `build/app.js`

Removes the compiled app file from build.

## Deploying to Heroku

Build/deploy pipeline of this project relies on two environment variables:
```
NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
PRODUCTION=true
```
When it comes to deploying to Heroku you have two options for deployment:

### With "Deploy to Heroku" button
If you deploy on Heroku with the button on top of this page, you don't need to change anything as environment varialbes are read from `app.json`

### With console
If you deploy to Heroku via command line (like in [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app) tutorial), you will need to setup these 2 env variables. 
In order to do this, execute next lines from console once you setup Heroku:

```
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
heroku config:set PRODUCTION=true
```

If you don't do this, Heroku will fail to build your app (during `git push heroku master`) as environment variables will not be set.
